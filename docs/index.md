# SYNGAN Design & Implementation Knowledge

This directory is the canonical knowledge bundle for SYNGAN.

## Authority order

```text
methodology / design authority
  > problem knowledge
  > concepts
  > dependence / application family / synchronization / composition
  > concept mapping / experience
  > design-quality / misfit validation
  > representation / architecture design
  > implementation planning history
  > code / tests / deployment evidence
  > ADR rationale / phase history / backlog / examples
```

Existing architecture, source or tests never become upstream concept-design authority merely because they exist or pass.

## Current governing authority

- [Concept Design Methodology](authority/design-methodology.md)
- [Jackson Design Completion & Implementation Hold](authority/jackson-design-completion-implementation-hold.md)
- [Jackson Methodology Completion Matrix](authority/jackson-methodology-completion-matrix.md)
- [Problem & Purpose](problem/problem-purpose.md)
- [Accepted Concept Catalog](concepts/index.md)
- [Concept Dependence & Application Family](dependence/index.md)
- [Synchronization Authority](synchronizations/index.md)
- [Phase 009 Consolidation](authority/phase-009-dependence-composition-consolidation.md)
- [Concept Mapping Authority](mapping/index.md)
- [Phase 010 Concept Mapping Consolidation](authority/phase-010-concept-mapping-consolidation.md)
- [Phase 011](phases/011/index.md)
- [011 Entry & Decomposition](phases/011/011-entry-decomposition.md)

## Product form

SYNGAN is a deployable Python/Spark framework package.

> **Platform agnosticism means agnostic across compliant Spark-capable hosting and infrastructure platforms.**

Spark/PySpark remains the current required processing environment. A host may provide notebooks, jobs, identity, scheduling, storage/catalog, logging and infrastructure UI without becoming semantic authority.

Primary interaction is package/notebook/automation. CLI, reports, rich graphical presentation, network service/API deployment and dedicated operator/admin applications remain optional adapters or host integrations.

## Completed Phase 010 mapping program

```text
66 / 66 command groups                    SEMANTICALLY MAPPED
52 / 52 query groups                      SEMANTICALLY MAPPED
11 / 11 lifecycle/history envelopes       SEMANTICALLY MAPPED
5 / 5 cross-concept explanation patterns  SEMANTICALLY MAPPED
11 / 11 accepted concept names            LINGUISTICALLY ALIGNED
66 / 66 command groups                    PHYSICAL RESPONSIBILITY MAPPED
52 / 52 query groups                      PHYSICAL RESPONSIBILITY MAPPED
10 / 10 required family/capability replays PASS
20 / 20 difficult-condition parity probes PASS
```

Phase 010 remains the completed mapping authority. Phase 011 does not remap concepts by default; it tests the resulting design for specificity, familiarity, integrity, synergy, scenario/adversarial misfit, future-scope pressure and residual conceptual debt.

## Phase 011 decomposition

```text
011-A  validation authority / evidence hierarchy / probe taxonomy / misfit-reopen rules
011-B  specificity / purpose alignment / boundary sharpness
011-C  familiarity / reuse / vocabulary / external-model comparison
011-D  integrity under synchronization / correction / invalidation / history
011-E  synergy / simplicity / generic fitness / conceptual burden
011-F  archetypal / exceptional / progressive-disclosure misfit replay
011-G  adversarial / degraded / recovery / scale / provider-semantic leakage
011-H  future-scope / extensibility / new-capability pressure / rediscovery triggers
011-I  residual conceptual misfit register / dispositions
011-J  Phase 011 consolidation / G1-G7 decision / Phase 012 handoff
```

All eight non-blocking Phase 010 residual risks are assigned explicit Phase 011 audit ownership.

## Implementation status rule

Through Phases 011-014:

```text
IMPLEMENTATION READINESS   NOT READY
IMPLEMENTATION START       NOT STARTED
IMPLEMENTATION NEXT        NOT YET
```

Do not translate concepts, family variants, mapping roles or Phase 011 audit categories mechanically into packages, services, schemas, endpoints, UI components, workflow engines, deployment units, runtime enums or product SKUs.

Phase 012 may declare Jackson concept design complete. Phase 013 reconciles representation/architecture. Only a positive Phase 014 may make implementation **READY / NOT STARTED / NEXT**; implementation itself still requires Phase 015.

## Current next boundary

**011-A — Validation Authority, Evidence Hierarchy, Probe Taxonomy & Misfit/Reopen Rules** is next eligible.
